# Physical Design

The physical design of a project refers to how its source files get layed out on disk.

## Legion's Monorepo

Legion is a monorepo in the sense that it hosts multiple directly unrelated applications and pieces of software. Monorepos encourage everyone to hold ownership of the end goal rather than the individual pieces that comprise it. This can lead to people feeling more involved and better informed about what’s going on. Monorepos reduce duplicate actions. If you need to refactor, it’s a single Find and Replace to apply the change across the codebase. There’s less switching between projects and fewer pull requests to review. On the negative side, relying on a commit to identify changes for individual components is not possible anymore, as a single commit can contain changes unrelated changes to unrelated components.
