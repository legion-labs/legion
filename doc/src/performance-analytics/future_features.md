# future feature ideas

## video capture
 * with dynamic overlay

## event structure
 * allow creation of structure a posteriori
   * i.e. parse log strings to transform into columns
 * allow transformation of structures
   * transform in query
   * transform in ingestion
 
## tagging
 * tag values to clarify meaning
 * tag rows
   * to mark them as known
   * to reference an external system like task management

## search
  * take inspiration from splunk search language and piped transforms
  * lucene query syntax also interesting
  * negative search
    * what have I never seen before?
    * which map has not been loaded/built?
    * which gameplay state has not been seen recently?

## low-level profiling
  * sampling
  * context switches

## analytics
 * A/B test anything
 * explicit funnel model
