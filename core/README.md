# Core libraries and Bevy basis

In August 2021 we decided to bootstrap the engine runtime to use bevy as a fork. As we are targetting AAA/AA developpers the team felt like we need to take ownership of that part of the code as we are experimenting with ways to do that in Rust. We will try to contribute back to Bevy if it doesn't go against their direction.

> It is important to keep the Bevy Authors in the author list of the Bevy imported crates.
