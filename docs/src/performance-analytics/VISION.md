# Introduction
## Definition
- `Performance`: quantified non-functional requirement
- **The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you.**â€• Robert M. Pirsig, _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values_
- Performance for software
  - Latency
    * ex.: frame time, reaction time, replication time, load time
  - Stability
    * ex.: MTBF, crashes, error logs, memory use
  - Satisfaction
    * ex.: retention, engagement, biometrics, surveys

# Introduction
## Stages of data storage

![bg right](figures/disk.jpg)
- **in-app**: buffered streams of structured events
- **Data Lake**
  * write-friendly format
  * shallow index
- **Data Lakehouse**
  - deeply indexed
  - just-in-time
  - distributed query engine

# Introduction
## Levels of analytics

![bg right](figures/fire.jpg)
- in-app: HUD, adjust verbosity of telemetry
- Process stats: MTBF, max memory use, run time
- Deep inspection of a single session: Mem use of every asset, flame graphs for entire process
- Aggregates of high-frequency events over many sessions: Dashboards, Heat maps

# Requirements
## Frequency of events

- High Frequency: thousands of events per frame
  * begin/end function call: ~40 ns per event
  * begin/end asset-specific scope
  * memory alloc/free

# Requirements
## Frequency of events

![bg right height:100%](figures/editor_metrics.png)

- Frame Frequency
  * frame time, engine time, render sync
  * player health, #npcs
  * process memory allocated/available
  * i.e. mostly time series
  
---
# Requirements
## Frequency of events
![bg right](figures/train.jpg)
- Process Frequency
  * begin/end app state (world loaded, in-play, matchmaking)
  * warnings, errors
  * crashes with callstack

---
# Requirements
## Generic and Extensible event stream format

- Open/Closed principle: open for extension, but closed for modification
- Adding a feature-specific event should have no impact on ingestion pipeline
- No magic: specific reports/views depend on the presence of specific events
  * tagging of streams to advertise the purpose/suitability
  * i.e. dynamic duck typing
- not limited to time series

---
# Requirements
## Generic and Extensible event stream format
### Performance characteristics
- write-friendly
  * most work is done with memcpy
  * important size optim: object references
- ingest-friendly
  * store without parsing whole block
  * compressed payload is not decompressed
- generic reader
  * as generic as JSON
  * metadata to decode the writer's memory model
---
# Requirements
## Understanding distributed applications

![bg right](figures/merlin.jpg)
- Processes are part of a tree
- Track latency and stability across machines & architectures

---
# Requirements
## 5 views to rule over all data
### List / Table / Search
![bg right](figures/process_list.png)

* recent processes
* top crashes
* cpu budget report
  
---

# Requirements
## 5 views to rule over all data
### Time series

![bg right height:100%](figures/editor_metrics.png)

---
# Requirements
## 5 views to rule over all data
### Graphs & Trees
![bg right](figures/metro.jpg)

---
# Requirements
## 5 views to rule over all data
### Timeline
![width:100%](figures/editor_timeline.png)
* Function calls per thread
* Audio effects per stream


---
# Requirements
## 5 views to rule over all data
### Heatmap
